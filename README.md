**FAST AIR - AIRLINE Reservation Portal**
This project represents an Airline Reservation System. 
At a high level, the application is based on a three-tier MVC design pattern. The database layer uses MySQL Version 8.0.35, and the user interface is built in ASP.NET (C#) as an MVC application. 

The business logic is part of the controllers and data model, with a couple of APIs developed to help passengers/customers search for flights, book flights with assigned seats, and access applicable services.
The database has 11 tables in total, each representing a business entity. 

Stored procedures and views will be developed to interact with the database from the MVC web application. Certain tables have constraints on how data is inserted and maintained. 
The database is named "fastair" and the application is named "ReserveFAST."

The application is managed by an admin user who has elevated privileges to manage bookings and passenger data.
